# Attack of Opportunity
#Actions/Reaction 

**Trigger:** A creature within your reach uses a #Ability-tag/Manipulate action or a #Ability-tag/Move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.

Make a melee [[Strike]] against the triggering creature. If your attack was a critical hit and the trigger was a #Ability-tag/Manipulate action, you disrupt the action. This strike **does not count toward multiple attack penalty**, and the **penalty doesn't apply to this strike**.
