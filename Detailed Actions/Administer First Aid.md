# Administer First Aid
#Actions/2 
#Ability-tag/Manipulate 

**Requirement:** You're holding or wearing _healer's tools_.

You perform first aid on a creature that is [[Dying]] or Bleeding (see Persistent Damage in the [[Gameplay Mind Map.canvas|Gameplay Mind Map]]). If the creature is afflicted by both, decide which one you want this action to affect before rolling. You may use this action again to deal with the other effect.

## Stabilize

Perform a **Medicine check** on a creature that is at 0 HP and [[Dying]]. The DC is **5 + Recovery Roll DC** (typically 15 + dying value)

## Stop Bleeding
Attempt a **Medicine check** on a creature suffering persistent Bleed damage, giving them another chance to make a flat check to remove the persistent damage. The DC tends to be the DC of the effect causing the bleed.

## Results

* **Success:** If you're trying to Stabilize, the creature loses the Dying condition but remains unconscious. If you're trying to stop bleeding, the creature attempts a flat check to end the bleeding.
* **Critical failure:** If you were trying to stabilize, the creature's [[Dying]] value increases by 1. If you were trying to stop bleeding, the creature immediately takes another set of persistent bleed damage.
