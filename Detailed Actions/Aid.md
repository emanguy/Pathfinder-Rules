# Aid
#Actions/Reaction

* Trigger: An ally is about to use an action that requires a skill check or attack roll
* Requirements: The ally is willing to accept your aid and you've prepared to aid them somehow
* To use aid, you need to do something (usually an action) to help your ally during their turn
* When the reaction triggers, perform an **attack roll or skill check** as determined by your GM - the **DC for this check is 20** but it may be adjusted by the DM for particularly easy or hard tasks

## Outcomes
* **Critical success**  - your ally gains a circumstance bonus based on your proficiency with the check you performed
	* **+4** for legendary proficiency
	* **+3** for master proficiency
	* **+2** otherwise
* **Success** - your ally gains a **+1** bonus to the check
* **Critical failure** - your ally suffers a **-1** to the check
