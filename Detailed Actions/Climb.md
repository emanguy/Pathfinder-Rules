#Ability-tag/Move 

**Requirement:** You have both hands free.

You move up, down, or across an incline. Unless it's easy, do an **athletics check**. During this action you're [[Flat-footed]] unless you have a climb speed.

* **Critical success:** You successfully move across the surface for 5 feet plus 5 feet for every 20 feet of land speed your character has (e.g. if your speed is 30 this will be 10 feet or 5+5, if your speed is 40 or 50 this movement will be 15 feet or 5+10).
* **Success:** You successfully move across the surface for 5 feet per 20 feet of your land speed with a minimum of 5 (e.g. if your land speed is 30 this will be 5 feet, if it's 40 or 50 this will be 10 feet)
* **Critical failure:** You fall. If you started the climb on stable ground you fall [[Prone]].
