# Command an Animal
#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Auditory #Ability-tag/Concentrate 

You try to order an animal - make a **Nature check** against the animal's **Will DC**, which may be adjusted if the animal has a good attitude toward you, you suggest something it wants to do, or you offer it a treat.

You auto-fail if the animal is [[Hostile]] or [[Unfriendly]] toward you. If the animal is [[Helpful]] to you, increase your degree of success by 1 step. You may be able to command an animal more easily with a feat like _Ride_.

Most animals know [[Drop Prone]], [[Leap]], [[Seek]], [[Stand]], [[Stride]], and [[Strike]] basic actions. If the animal knows an activity, you can command it to do that too (like a Horse's _Gallop_). Activities require you to **spend as many actions on Command an Animal as the Animal would spend on the activity**. You can also use this action multiple times to issue multiple commands to the animal.

* **Success:** The animal does as you command on its next turn.
* **Failure:** The animal is hesitant or resistant and does nothing.
* **Critical failure:** The animal misbehaves or misunderstands and takes some other action as determined by the GM.
