# Conceal an Object
#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Manipulate #Ability-tag/Secret 

You hide a small object on your person. When you try to sneak a concealed object past a person, the GM rolls your **Stealth check** against the person's **Perception DC**. This result is then used for future people you try to sneak the object past.

If a creature is looking for the item, it might make an active **Perception check** against your **Stealth DC**. This also applies if you hid the object somewhere like in a bush.

* **Success:** The object remains undetected.
* **Failure:** The searcher finds the object.
