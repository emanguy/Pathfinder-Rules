# Create a Diversion
#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Mental 

You attempt to distract a set of creatures to draw their attention away from you. If you use a **gesture or trick**, this action gains the #Ability-tag/Manipulate attribute. If you use **distracting words** it gains the #Ability-tag/Auditory and #Ability-tag/Linguistic traits.

Perform a **deception check** and compare it to the **perception DC** of the creatures you're trying to divert. Whether you succeed or not, your targets get a **+4 circumstance bonus** to your future attempts to use this action for 1 minute.

* **Success:** You become [[Hidden]] to each creature whose perception DC is less than or equal to the result, allowing you to [[Sneak]] away. This lasts until the end of your turn or until you do anything except [[Step]], [[Hide]], or [[Sneak]]. If you [[Strike]] a distracted creature, it's [[Flat-footed]] against the attack and you become [[Observed]]. If you do anything else, you become Observed right before the action unless your DM rules otherwise.
* **Failure:** You don't divert the attention of creatures whose perception DC exceeds your result and they're aware you were trying to trick them.
