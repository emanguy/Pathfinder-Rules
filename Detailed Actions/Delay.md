# Delay
* **Free action**
	* Trigger: your turn begins
* You are removed from the initiative order.
* As a free action, you re-enter initiative triggered by the end of another creature's turn. Your new initiative position is now permanent.
* You cannot delay past when your turn would normally be - if you do, you effectively lose your turn
* Any persistent damage or effects that happen at the start or end of your turn occur when you take the delay action.
