# Disarm
#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Attack 

**Requirement:** You're trained in athletics, you have at least one hand free, and the target isn't more than a size larger than you.

Perform an **athletics check** against the target's **reflex DC** to knock something out of a creature's grasp.

* **Critical success:** You knock the item out of the target's grasp and it falls to the ground in the target's space.
* **Success:** You weaken your target's grasp on the item. Until the start of the creature's turn, attempts to disarm them gain a **+2 circumstance bonus**. The target takes a **-2 circumstance penalty** to attacks with the item or other checks requiring a firm grasp on it.
* **Critical failure:** You lose your balance and become [[Flat-footed]] until the start of your next turn.
