# Fly

#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Move 

**Requirement:** You have a fly speed.

You move through the air up to your fly speed. **Moving upward follows the rules for [[Difficult Terrain]]**. Moving straight downward lets you move 10 feet for every 5 feet of fly speed. Flying to the ground doesn't cause fall damage.

You can use an action to fly 0 feet and hover in place. If you don't do this and you're airborne at the end of your turn you fall.
