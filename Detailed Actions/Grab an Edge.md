#Ability-tag/Manipulate 
#Actions/Reaction 


When you fall by an edge on handhold, you try to grab it
You need to succeed on a reflex save using the **climb DC**
If you successfully manage to hold on you can climb up using Athletics 

**Critical Succcess** You manage to hold on even if you don't have a free hand using an applicable item. You take damage based on how for you fell but you treat it as if you fell **30 fewer feet**

**Success** If you do have a free hand you manage to hold on. If you don't you treat the check like you failed. If you did succeed you take fall damage for the full distance you fell but you treat it like you fell 20 fewer feet.
