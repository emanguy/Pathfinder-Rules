# Hide
#Ability-tag/Secret 

You hide behind Cover or Greater Cover to become [[Hidden]]. The DM rolls your **Stealth check** against the **Perception DC** of creatures you have Cover or Greater Cover against or are [[Concealed]] from. You gain the **circumstance bonus from cover or greater cover** for this check.

* **Success:** If the creature could see you, you're now [[Hidden]] rather than [[Observed]]. You stay [[Hidden]] or [[Undetected]] if you were before.
  
  If you leave cover/greater cover or concealment you automatically become [[Observed]] by the creature again. You cease being hidden if you take any action other than [[Hide]], [[Sneak]], or [[Step]].
  
  If you attempt to [[Strike]] a creature, the creature is [[Flat-footed]] against the attack and then you become [[Observed]]. Otherwise, with any other action you become [[Observed]] right before you act unless the DM says otherwise. They may allow you to take an unobtrusive action without being noticed and this **may require a stealth check**.
  
  If a creature uses [[Seek]] to make you observed, you must successfully [[Hide]] to become hidden from it again.
