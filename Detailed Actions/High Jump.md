# High Jump
#Actions/2 

You [[Stride]], then make a vertical [[Leap]] and attempt a **DC 30 athletics check** to increase the height of your jump. If you **didn't stride at least 10 feet** you automatically fail the check. The DM may choose to increase or decrease the DC depending on the situation.

* **Critical success:** Increase the maximum movement distance of Leap to 8 feet straight up or 5 feet up and 10 feet horizontally.
* **Success:** Increase the maximum vertical distance of Leap to 5 feet straight up.
* **Failure:** You Leap normally.
* **Critical failure:** You don't Leap at all and instead fall [[Prone]] in your space.
