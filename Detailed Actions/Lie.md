You try to lie to someone. This takes **1 round** unless the lie is elaborate. The DM rolls a **secret deception check** against the **perception DC** of each creature you try to fool. Your targets may get circumstance bonuses depending on how believable the lie is.

The DM may later have a creature that believes your lie do a [[Sense Motive]] against your **deception DC** to realize that you were lying. This usually happens in the face of evidence that counters your statement.

* **Success:** The creature believes your lie.
* **Failure:** The creature doesn't believe your lie and gains a **+4 circumstance bonus** to future attempts to lie during your conversation. The creature is also more likely to be suspicious of you in the future.
