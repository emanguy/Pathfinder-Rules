# Long Jump
#Actions/2 

You [[Stride]], then make a horizontal [[Leap]] and do an **Athletics Check** with a DC equal to the total distance you're trying to move during your Leap. You **can't leap further than your speed**. If you **didn't stride at least 10 feet or Leap in a different direction from the stride** you automatically fail the check. The GM may adjust the DC situationally.

* **Success:** Increase the maximum horizontal distance of Leap to the desired jump distance.
* **Failure:** You Leap normally.
* **Critical failure:** You Leap normally, then land and fall [[Prone]].
