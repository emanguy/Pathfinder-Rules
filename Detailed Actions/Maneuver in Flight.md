# Maneuver in Flight
#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Move 

**Requirements:** You have a fly speed and are trained in acrobatics.

You try a difficult maneuver while flying, but not necessarily one that increases your fly speed. Roll an **acrobatics check**.

* **Success:** You succeed on the maneuver.
* **Failure:** Your maneuver fails and the GM determines what happens as a result.
* **Critical failure:** Same as failure, but the consequences are more dire.
