**Requirements:** A creature is [[Undetected]] by one or more of your allies but isn't by you

You point out a creature you've noticed to your allies. It now becomes [[Hidden]] to them rather than [[Undetected]]. This only works for allies that can see/understand you and are in a position where they could detect the target. If they can't, they need to succeed a Perception check against the creature's Stealth DC or they misunderstand and think the target is in a different location.
