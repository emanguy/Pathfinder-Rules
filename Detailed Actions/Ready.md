# Ready

#Actions/2
#Ability-tag/Concentrate

* You prepare an action that will happen outside your turn.
* Choose a single action ( #Actions/1 ) or a free action ( #Actions/Free ) and a trigger. Your turn ends.
	* If the trigger you designated happens before the start of your next turn, you may perform the chosen action as a reaction
	* You **cannot** ready a free action that already has a trigger
* If you have **Multiple attack penalty** and your chosen action is an #Ability-tag/Attack action, your attack takes the penalty you had when you used Ready.
