# Seek

#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Concentrate #Ability-tag/Secret

* You search an area for signs of creatures or objects
	* If you need precision for **creatures**, the GM will have you select a **30 foot cone** or a **15 foot burst** within line of sight
		* You may take a penalty if it's an area further away
	* If this is a search for **nearby objects**, you may choose up to a 10-foot square adjacent to you, though this may become a longer activity if the area is cluttered (more actions or could be minutes/hours)
* The GM rolls a **secret perception check** on your behalf and compares it to the **Stealth DCs** of undetected or hidden creatures in the area or the **DC to detect each object**
	* Creatures **may remain [[Hidden]] and not [[Observed]]** if you're using an imprecise sense like hearing or if the creature is under an effect such as [[Invisible]]

* **Critical Success** - Any **creatures** you critically succeeded against become [[Observed]] and if you were searching for an **object** you learn its location
* **Success** - Any [[Undetected]] **creatures** you succeeded against are now [[Hidden]], and any [[Hidden]] creatures are now [[Observed]]. If you were searching for an **object**, you either learn its location or get a clue to its whereabouts (determined by the GM)
