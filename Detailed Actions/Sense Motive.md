# Sense Motive

#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Concentrate #Ability-tag/Secret 

* You try to determine if a creature's behavior is weird
* The GM rolls a **secret perception check** for you and compares the result to the creature's deception DC, appropriate magical effect DC, or other DC decided on by the GM
* You can't sense motive again **until the situation changes significantly**

* **Critical success** - You determine the creature's true intentions or what magic might be affecting it.
* **Success** - You can tell if the creature is behaving normally, but you don't know its intentions or details of what magic might be affecting it.
* **Failure** - The creature's deception works on you. If they're not being deceptive, you think they're behaving normally
* **Critical Failure** - You get a false sense of the creature's intentions.
