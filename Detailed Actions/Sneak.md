Try to move to another place while remaining or becoming [[Undetected]]. [[Stride]] up to half your speed (incl. Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming). If you're **undetected by a creature and it's impossible for it to see you** your critical failures become failures instead. You also continue to be undetected if you lose cover/greater cover or lose [[Concealed]].

At the end of your movement, the DM rolls your **Stealth check** in secret against the **Perception DC** of every creature you were hidden from or undetected by at the start of your movement. This check receives the **bonuses granted by cover/greater cover**, but because you're moving you don't receive the benefit of [[Take Cover]]. If you are not **[[Concealed]] from or have cover/greater cover against a creature** you don't roll against them, you automatically become [[Observed]].

* **Success:** You're [[Undetected]] by the creature during your movement and remain undetected at the end of it.
  
  You become [[Observed]] as soon as you do anything other than [[Hide]], [[Sneak]], or [[Step]]. Attempting to [[Strike]] a creature makes it [[Flat-footed]] against the attack, then you become [[Observed]]. Doing anything else causes you to become Observed just before the action.
