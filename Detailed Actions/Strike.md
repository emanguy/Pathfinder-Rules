#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Attack 

You attack with a weapon you're holding or an unarmed attack, targeting a creature within reach or within range.

Roll to attack against a creature, using their AC. Add proficiency and ability scores to the roll.

Performing more than one on the same turn incurs penalties:
* **-5 to hit** on the second attack
* **-10 to hit** on the third attack
