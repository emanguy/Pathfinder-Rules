# Strike

#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Attack 

You attack with a weapon you're holding or an unarmed attack, targeting a creature within reach or within range.

Roll to attack against a creature, using their AC. Add proficiency and ability scores to the roll.

Performing more than one on the same turn incurs penalties:
* **-5 to hit** on the second attack
* **-10 to hit** on the third attack

**Success:** You deal damage according to the weapon or unarmed attack, including modifiers/bonuses/penalties you have to damage
**Critical success:** Same as success, but the damage dealt is doubled (damage from effects that only trigger on crits are not doubled, but the roll and modifiers are)
