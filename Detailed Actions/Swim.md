# Swim
#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Move 

You propel yourself through water. If you're submerged and must breathe air, you need to hold your breath. If the **water is turbulent**, you'll need to make an **athletics check**.

If you end your turn in water and haven't completed a successful swim action you **sink 10 feet or get moved by the current** unless you entered the water on this turn.

* **Critical success:** You move 10 feet through the water plus 5 feet for every 20 feet of land speed you have (i.e. a speed of 30 gives you 10 feet + 5 feet while 50 feet would give you 10 feet + 10 feet).
* **Success:** You move 10 feet through the water plus 5 feet for every 20 feet of land speed you have (i.e. a speed of 30 gives you 5 feet + 5 feet while 50 feet would give you 5 feet + 10 feet)
* **Critical failure:** You make no progress and if you're holding your breath you lose 1 round of air.
