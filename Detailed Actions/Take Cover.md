# Take Cover

#Actions/1 

**Requirements:** You're benefiting from cover or are near a feature that allows you to take cover, or are [[Prone]]

You hide behind cover to take better advantage of it - you get a **situational bonus of +4** if you were already in standard cover (granting **greater cover**) or you just get standard cover, giving a **+2** to:
* AC
* Reflex saves against area effects
* Stealth checks to [[Hide]], [[Sneak]], or other checks to avoid detection
