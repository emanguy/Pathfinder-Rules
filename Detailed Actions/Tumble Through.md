# Tumble Through
#Actions/1 
#Ability-tag/Move 

You [[Stride]] up to your speed through an enemy's space. Make an **Acrobatics check** against the target creature's **Reflex DC**. You may also [[Swim]], [[Climb]], [[Fly]], or perform another movement action instead of striding if the environment calls for it.

* **Success:** You move through the target creature's space, treating it like [[Difficult Terrain]]. If you don't have the speed to move through the space it counts as a failure.
* **Failure:** Your movement ends before entering the creature's space and you trigger reactions as if you moved out of the space you started in.
