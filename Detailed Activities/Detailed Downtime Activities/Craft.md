**Requirements:** trained in crafting.

You need certain feats to craft items:
1. **Alchemical Crafting** for alchemical items
2. **Magical Crafting** for magic items
3. **Snare Crafting** for snares

There are requirements for crafting items:
* The item is **your level or lower**. An item not specifying a level is level 0.
	* If the item is **9th level or higher** you need to be a master in crafting
	* If the item is **16th level or higher** you need to be legendary in crafting
* You **have the formula** for the item
* You have the correct **set of tools and possibly a workshop** (e.g. a smithy for a metal shield or an alchemist's lab for alchemical items)
* You supply **raw materials worth at least half the item's price**. You always spend at least that amount on materials when crafting successfully. In a settlement, you can probably purchase raw materials you need unless they are rare

You spend **at least 4 days working on crafting** then perform a crafting check. The GM determines the DC based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances (see [[DC Tables]]).

On a successful craft, you **expend the materials you supplied**. You may then choose to:
1. Pay the remaining portion of the item's material price to complete it right away
2. Spend additional days working on the item. For each day, reduce the cost of materials spent building the item using the table in [[Earn Income]], using your crafting proficiency and level instead of a task level
