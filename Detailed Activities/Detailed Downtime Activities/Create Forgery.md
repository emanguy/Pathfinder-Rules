**Requirements:** trained in society

When you create a forgery, you need the proper writing materials. The GM makes a **secret DC 20 Society check** on your behalf to determine if the forgery is passable at a first glance. If this check succeeds, a creature will only notice the forgery if they make an **active Perception or Society check against your Society DC**.

If the document's handwriting doesn't need to be specific to a person, you just need to have seen a similar one before and you get a **up to a +4 circumstance bonus** to the check and your society DC. You'll need a sample of the author's handwriting if it does need to be a specific person's handwriting.

If the **roll is below 20** the result is compared against observers' passive perception or society to determine if the forgery is immediately obvious.
