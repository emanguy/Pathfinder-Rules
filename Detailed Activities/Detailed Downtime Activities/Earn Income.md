# Earn Income
#Ability-tag/Downtime 

**Requirements:** trained in the skill you are using to earn income (either Crafting, Lore, or Performance typically - other skills can be used situationally).

You use a skill to earn money - typically Crafting, Lore, or Performance (though other skills might be used situationally and the DC for this task will be higher than usual).

Based on what you're doing, the DM will assign a task level to your work and have you roll a check with the chosen skill to do the job. **You may spend time preparing** to reduce the DC of the check. On a successful job, you earn income based on the task level and your proficiency in the skill:
