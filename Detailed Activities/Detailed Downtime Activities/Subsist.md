# Subsist
#Ability-tag/Downtime 

Make a **Society or Survival check** (depending on if you're in a settlement or in the wild) to provide food and shelter for yourself, paying money based on the standard of living you're going for and the amount of time you're spending there.

You may need a minimum proficiency rank for subsisting in certain environments.
