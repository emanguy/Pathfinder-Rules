# Subsist
#Ability-tag/Downtime 

Make a **Society or Survival check** (depending on if you're in a settlement or in the wild) to provide food and shelter for yourself and possibly another person by living off the land.

You may need a minimum proficiency rank for subsisting in certain environments.

| Training Level | Environment                                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Untrained      | Lush forest with calm weather or large city with plentiful resources |
| Trained        | Typical hillside or village                                          |
| Expert         | Typical mountains or insular hamlet                                  |
| Master         | Typical desert or city under siege                                   |
| Legendary      | Barren wasteland or city of undead                                   |
If you **subsist during exploration** (i.e. trying to live off the land since you ran out of food) you take a -5 penalty to the check.

* **Critical success:** You provide subsistence for yourself and one other creature or manage to upgrade to the "comfortable" living standard.
* **Success:** You get enough food and shelter to get by.
* **Failure:** You're exposed to the elements and don't get enough food, becoming [[Fatigued]] until you get sufficient food and shelter.
* **Critical failure:** You get into a bad situation. You take a -2 penalty to subsistence activities for 1 week. If you don't have food on you you're in danger of starving or dying of thirst on continued failures.
