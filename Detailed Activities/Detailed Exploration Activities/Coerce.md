You try to bully a creature into doing what you want. You have to converse with the creature **for at least 1 minute** who can either see or sense you. Perform an **intimidation check against the target's Will DC**.

* **Critical Success:** The target complies as long as they won't harm the target. They continue complying for up to 1 day as determined by the GM, at which point the target becomes [[Unfriendly]] if they weren't already that or [[Hostile]]. The target is too scared to retaliate in the short term.
* **Success:** Just like critical success but they may decide to act against you once they become unfriendly.
* **Failure:** The target refuses and becomes [[Unfriendly]] if they weren't already that or [[Hostile]].
* **Critical failure:** The target refuses and becomes [[Hostile]]. They can't be coerced by you for at least **1 week**.
