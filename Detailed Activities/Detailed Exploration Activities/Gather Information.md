Make a **Diplomacy check** to ask around to learn about a specific individual or topic. It typically takes about 2 hours, but may be different at the DM's discretion. The DC is affected by benefit you can gain by spending coin on bribes, drinks, or gifts.

* **Success:** You collect information about the individual or topic.
* **Critical failure:** You collect incorrect information about the individual or topic.
