The GM rolls a **secret Deception Check** to disguise yourself as something or someone you are not. Convincing disguises require 10 minutes and a _disguise kit_ but if you're not trying to impersonate a specific person the GM may allow you to do a simple, quick disguise.

Creatures will detect your disguise if they use the [[Seek]] action do perception checks against your deception DC.

If you interact with someone while disguised, the GM will do a secret deception check for you against the creature's perception DC. Creatures familiar with the individual you're disguised as may get a circumstance bonus on the secret check.

* **Success:** You trick the creature into thinking you're the person you're disguised as. You may need to re-roll this check if your behavior changes.
* **Failure:** The creature can tell you're not who you claim to be.
* **Critical Failure:** The creature can tell you're not who you claim to be and recognizes you if it would know you without a disguise.
