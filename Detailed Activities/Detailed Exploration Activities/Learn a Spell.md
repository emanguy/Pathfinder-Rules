# Learn a Spell
#Ability-tag/Concentrate 
#Ability-tag/Exploration 

**Requirement:** You have a spellcasting class feature and the spell you want to learn is in your spell list. You are trained in the ability you're using for the check (Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion).

You gain access to a spell from someone else or a magic scroll. If you have multiple magic traditions, you must use the appropriate skill for that tradition to learn the spell. Here's what's required to learn it:

* Spend 1 hour per level of the spell conversing with your tutor or reading the magic scroll
* Have materials with the price indicated in the below table

| Spell Level    | Price  | Typical DC |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 1st or cantrip | 2gp    | 15         |
| 2nd            | 6gp    | 18         |
| 3rd            | 16gp   | 20         |
| 4th            | 36gp   | 23         |
| 5th            | 70gp   | 26         |
| 6th            | 140gp  | 28         |
| 7th            | 300gp  | 31         |
| 8th            | 650gp  | 34         |
| 9th            | 1500gp | 36         |
| 10th           | 7000gp | 41         |

* Attempt a skill check for the difficulty of learning the spell + the rarity of the spell (see [[DC Tables#Adjustments based on difficulty & rarity]])

If you have a spellbook, this action adds the spell to your spellbook on a success. If you prepare them from a list, it gets added to your list. If you have a spell repertoire, you can select it when you add or swap spells.

* **Critical success:** You spend half the materials necessary to learn the spell
* **Success:** You expend the materials and learn the spell.
* **Failure:** You fail to learn the spell but can try again when you gain a level. The materials aren't expended.
* **Critical failure:** Same as failure but you expend half the materials.
