#Ability-tag/Exploration 
#Ability-tag/Secret 

Make a **Survival check** to orient yourself in the world based on your surroundings. This typically only needs to be done once per day, and usually only takes about a minute.

You may need higher training levels to sense direction in certain environments. Not having a _compass_ applies a **-2 item penalty** to this check.

* **Critical success:** You get an excellent sense of where you are and know exact cardinal directions
* **Success:** You gain enough orientation to avoid being completely lost and have a sense of the cardinal directions.
