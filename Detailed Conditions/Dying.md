# Dying Condition
* If you ever reach **Dying 4**, you die.
* If you're dying, make a recovery check on your turn to see if you get better or worse
* If you lose this condition via a recovery check **but you're still at 0HP**, you stabilize and are [[Unconscious]].
* You lose this condition and wake up automatically if you ever have 1HP or more.
* Anytime you lose the dying condition, you increase your [[Wounded]] condition level by 1
