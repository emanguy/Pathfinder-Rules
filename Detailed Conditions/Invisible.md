# Invisible
* An invisible creature is automatically [[Undetected]] for creatures relying on sight as their only precise sense
* You can use [[Seek]] to determine the location of an invisible creature, making them [[Hidden]], but they can then use [[Sneak]] to become [[Undetected]] again
* If you were looking at a creature when it becomes invisible, it becomes [[Hidden]] because you know where it was when it disappeared
* Other situations can make invisible creatures [[Hidden]] or [[Observed]] + [[Concealed]] - tracking a creature's footsteps in snow would make it Hidden, while throwing a net over it would make it observed but concealed
