# Unconscious Condition
* You cannot act
* You take a **-4 penalty to AC, perception, and reflex saves** and gain the [[Blinded]] and [[Flat-footed]] conditions
* You fall prone and drop items you're wielding or holding unless the DM or an effect states otherwise
* If you're unconscious because you're dying:
	* You can't wake up unless you gain hitpoints
	* If you're healed, you lose this and the [[Dying]] condition and can act normally on your next turn
* If you're unconscious and at 0 HP but not dying:
	* After a **minimum of 10 minutes**, you naturally return to 1 HP
	* If someone heals you, you lose this condition and can act normally again
* If you're unconscious and have hitpoints:
	* You wake up if you take damage
	* You wake up if someone heals you
	* You wake up if someone shakes you awake via an interact action
	* You wake up if loud noise is being made around you
		* If this is the case, you make a **perception check** to see if you wake up. The **DC is 5 for a battle**, otherwise use a creature's **stealth DC** if they're trying to be sneaky
	* If you're just asleep, the DM can determine if something wakes you without using the loud noise rules
