# Undetected
* You're aware a creature is there but you don't know where it might be.
* You're [[Flat-footed]] to an undetected creature
* Using [[Seek]] with a precise sense can help you make the creature [[Hidden]], but not necessarily [[Observed]]
* To attack an undetected creature, you can pick a square and attempt to attack it, but the GM will roll a **DC 11 Flat Check** and your **Attack Roll** in secret on your behalf so you don't know what part of the check you failed - either choosing the wrong square, failing the flat check, or failing the attack roll
