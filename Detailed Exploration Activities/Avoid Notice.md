# Avoid Notice

#Ability-tag/Exploration

Attempt a **Stealth Check** while moving at half speed 
* or full speed if you have **Swift Sneak**, but no secondary activity
* or full speed if you have **Legendary Sneak**, with a secondary activity

If starting an encounter while avoiding notice, **roll stealth for initiative** instead of perception and to see if enemies notice you (compare against their perception DCs)
