# Borrow an Arcane Spell

#Ability-tag/Concentrate 
#Ability-tag/Exploration 

**Requirements:** trained in arcana.

GM determines the DC for an **Arcana check** for learning a spell from someone else's spellbook based on its level and rarity (typically easier than learning the spell). 

* **Success:** You prepare the borrowed spell as part of your normal preparation
* **Failure:** You fail to prepare the spell, but the spell slot remains available for you to prepare a different spell. You can't try to prepare this spell again until the next time you prepare spells.
