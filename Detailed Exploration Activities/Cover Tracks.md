# Cover Tracks

#Ability-tag/Concentrate 
#Ability-tag/Exploration 
#Ability-tag/Move 
#Actions/1  (if used in an encounter)

You travel at **half speed** while covering your tracks. Anyone tracking you must succeed a **Survival Check** against your **Survival DC** if it's higher than the normal [[Track]] DC. 

This may be used during an encounter, in which case it's **one action** and doesn't have the exploration tag.
