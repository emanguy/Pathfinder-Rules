# Decipher Writing

#Ability-tag/Concentrate 
#Ability-tag/Exploration 
#Ability-tag/Secret 

You try to decipher complicated writing or literature on an obscure topic. This takes **1 minute per page** or longer depending on what it is (ciphers may take up to **1 hour per page**). The text must be in a language you understand, though the GM may allow you to use [[Society]] for an unfamiliar language.

The DC is based on the state or complexity of the document. Depending on the length, the GM may have you make multiple checks for different chunks of the text.

* **Critical success:** You understand the true meaning of the text.
* **Success:** You understand the true meaning of the text, but if it was a coded document you just get the general messaging and not a word-for-word translation.
* **Failure**: You can't understand the text and take a **-2 circumstance penalty** for further checks to decipher it.
* **Critical failure:** You think you understand the text on the page but you have misconstrued the message.
