**Requirement:** trained in the skill you're using for this (either Arcana, Occultism, or Religion)

Attempting to use a skill inappropriate for the magic increases the DC of the check.

* **Success:** You get a sense of what the magic does and how it's activated. For an ongoing effect, you learn its name and what it does.
* **Failure:** You fail to identify the magic and can't try again for 1 day
* **Critical failure:** You misidentify the magic as something else
