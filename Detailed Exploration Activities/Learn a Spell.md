#Ability-tag/Exploration 

**Requirement:** You have a spellcasting class feature and the spell you want to learn is in your spell list. You are trained in the ability you're using for the check (Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion).

You gain access to a spell from someone else or a magic scroll. If you have multiple magic traditions, you must use the appropriate skill for that tradition to learn the spell. Her
