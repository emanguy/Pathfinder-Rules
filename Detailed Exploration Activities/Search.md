# Search

#Ability-tag/Concentrate 
#Ability-tag/Exploration 

You [[Seek]] for hidden doors, concealed hazards, and so on. You move at **half speed** making educated guesses about where to look, but to do so you **can't move faster than 300 feet per minute** or **150 feet per minute to make sure you check everything**. You may need to go even slower if there are lots of things to search or to be even more thorough.

Coming across a secret door, item, or hazard will cause the GM to make a free Seek to notice the hidden object or hazard.
