Make an **Acrobatics Check** to contort yourself to get through a space so small you can barely fit through.

This is specifically for incredibly small spaces - other narrow spaces are usually [[Difficult Terrain]].

* **Critical success:** you move through the tight space in 1 minute per 10 feet of squeezing.
* **Success:** you squeeze through in 1 minute per 5 feet.
* **Critical Failure:** you become stuck in the tight space. You may spend 1 minute performing another acrobatics check - any result other than critical failure means you become unstuck.
