You follow tracks up to half your Exploration Speed (see exploration section in [[Gameplay Mind Map.canvas|Gameplay Mind Map]]).

During exploration, each success on your Survival check will allow you to continue following the trail for an hour. During an encounter, you use this ability for 1 action and it doesn't have the exploration tag. In encounters you need to make the check more frequently.

* **Success:** You find the trail or continue to follow it.
* **Failure:** You lose the trail but can try again after a 1-hour delay.
* **Critical failure:** You lose the trail and can't try again for 24 hours.
