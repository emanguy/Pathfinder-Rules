**Requirements:** You're wearing or holding _healer's tools_.

You spend 10 minutes treating one injured living creature. The creature is then **temporarily immune to Treat Wounds for 1 hour** which overlaps with the time you spent treating.

The DC for this check is usually 15 but may be adjusted by the DM.

* **Critical Success:** The target regains 4d8 HP and its [[Wounded]] condition is removed.
## Alternate DCs based on training
Injury caused on critical failure does not change based on these higher attempts.
* If you're an **Expert** in medicine, you can attempt a DC 20 check to increase HP gained by 10
* If you're a **Master** of medicine, you can attempt a DC 30 check to increase HP gained by 30
* If you have **Legendary** skill in medicine, you can attempt a DC 40 check to increase HP gained by 50.
