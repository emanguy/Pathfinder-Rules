#Ability-tag/Concentrate #Ability-tag/Secret

* You search an area for signs of creatures or objects
	* If you need precision for **creatures**, the GM will have you select a **30 foot cone** or a **15 foot burst** within line of sight
		* You may take a penalty if it's an area further away
	* If this is a search for **nearby objects**, you may choose up to a 10-foot square adjacent to you, though this may become a longer activity if the area is cluttered (more actions or could be minutes/hours)
